How would you create a AI from scratch? I think the best way is to implement it yourself, doing all research on your own and creating a better idea from a rather abstract form. It is good to look at other people's sample, but it is better to create an AI really from scratch. I believe the simple algorithms' building blocks will be essential to building this AI, and it will help make the AI's "parts" become interactive with each other. (C) Tsubasa Kato 2019
